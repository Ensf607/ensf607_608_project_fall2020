# setup

1. this is classic java project. `jars/mysql-connector-java-8.0.22.jar` needs to be added to class path. (alternatively, if you're using maven, just use pom.xml to fullfil the dependencies. ) 
2. using IDE is preferred



   

# development

- code style: as long as readable
- project structure

```
src/
├── client
├── devops
├── server
└── test
```

- isolating test classes recommended

# using it as references

project will remain public/open.
